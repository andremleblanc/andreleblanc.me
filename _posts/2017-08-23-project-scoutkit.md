## What is it?

ScoutKit is a tool to help businesses find and manage influencers on Instagram. I was inspired by
working with my wife, Charity, on her Instagram presence. It became clear to me that one of the
challenges businesses face when trying to do influencer marketing is simply finding influencers. The
process for many is to use the Instagram's app explore feature - this process is slow, time
consuming, and untargeted.

ScoutKit was going to improve this process by allowing businesses to connect their profile and build
a list of influencers based on their profile and other profiles they selected, like their
competitors. Basically, the app would look at the followers of the target profiles and then find
the people that those followers followed.

## What happened?

I got the app to an MVP - no machine learning, minimal UI, etc. I got it to the point I believed was
acceptable to submit to Instagram for approval. I was concerned from the beginning my app may not
meet [Instagram's Platform Policy](https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/terms/api/). Unfortunately,
my concern turned out to be valid - I got rejected with the below reason.

> Don't transfer any data that you receive from us (including anonymous, aggregate, or derived data)
> to any ad network, data broker, influencer network, or other advertising or monetization-related
> service.

After the rejection, I tried submitting the app again with some changes.

This experience did highlight the importance of Agile and MVP to me, as I got feedback on the app
really quickly. I spent a total of a month on the idea from conception to submission building out
the website, the app, and the deployment pipeline.

## Interesting Features

## Conclusion

After working on this project, I took some time to reflect on what I really wanted. When it started
to become a reality that I might soon have paying customers depending on my service, it started to
make me question if I was ready for that commitment. For the moment, I've decided that running my
own business is not something I want.

What I was really trying to accomplish and what really appeals to me is autonomy, purpose, and
financial freedom.

I still plan on working on side projects that, hopefully, are useful to people, and perhaps even
charging for them; but my motivation is no longer to replace my primary income with my own business.
I want my side projects to be more of a creative release for me - a change to try out new
technologies or new techniques; a chance to practice my craft in pursuit of mastery.
