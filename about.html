          <h3>Profile</h3>
          <p>
            Andre works on the production application at Accelerated Concepts. He performs
            full stack development ranging from implementing Javascript templating in the
            front-end, to Ruby on Rails development in the backend, to distributed
            services written in Java, to deploying those services using custom package
            tooling.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before Accelerated Concepts, Andre worked at Clarity Services as an
            Integration Engineer. While there, Andre supported customers integrating with
            the application, built tooling to automate parts of his job, and added
            features to the application to support other departments. The role of this
            position was officially expanded in part to his efforts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before Clarity Services, Andre did a mix of marketing, sales, and web
            consulting as both a freelancer and as an employee for Bruiser Conversions.
            While working for Bruiser Conversions, Andre helped the company launch and
            surpass its sales goals.

          <h4>Full Stack Software Developer | August 2015 - Present</h4>
          <p>
            One of four developers working on and supporting the
            production instances of the application. The application
            performs monitoring, control, and reporting for the devices the
            company sells.
          </p>
          <p>
            The application is written in Ruby on Rails and runs on
            Torquebox, a JRuby server with built in messaging, queuing, and
            scheduling. The front-end is mostly server side rendered html
            with some AJAX.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the application, we also work on an ecosystem of
            other services, mostly Java based, to support various features
            within the application.

          <p>
            One of two engineers providing technical support for customers
            integrating with the application. In addition to support, I
            also resolved bugs within the application and self-started a few
            auditing tools to support internal departments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The application was written in Ruby on Rails and ran on JRuby
            Puma. The front-end was all server side rendered html.
